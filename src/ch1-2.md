# Quantii's Goals
Quantii's ultimate goal is to become a competitor to the major operating systems
of today, spanning both desktop an mobile platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS,
Android, and iOS).

We want to provide a lean, portable, performant, secure, and accessible OS with
the user experience of artists, businesses, and developers at top-priority.

## Quantii's Non-Goals
We do not aim to be Unix-like or Windows-like in any way, nor POSIX-compliant.
Neither do we aim for familiarity for the case of older users used to 90s-style
user interfaces.
