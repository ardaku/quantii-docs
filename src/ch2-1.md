# Drivers
These lists are non-exhaustive and likely to change drastically.

## Kernel Drivers
There should be as few kernel drivers as possible (to reduce the amount of
unsandboxed drivers), and should be as close to the metal as they can (while
still being portable).  Kernel drivers interface with userspace via the Quantii
API.

 - USB
 - Bluetooth
 - Network
 - Display
 - Aux
 - Touchscreen
 - Power
 - Haptic
 - Accelerometer
 - Gyro
 - Broadband
 - GPIO
 - VFS (Virtual File System, or Filesystem-As-A-File)
 - WGPU
 - Built-in Camera

## Userspace Drivers / Services
Userspace drivers are drivers that run within the WebAssembly sandboxed
environment.  Userspace drivers are the only services that can  access the
Quantii API, so some just forward directly to the kernel driver.

 - Keyboard (deps: USB, Bluetooth)
 - Cursor (deps: USB, Touchscreen)
 - Joystick (deps: USB, Bluetooth)
 - Audio (deps: USB, Bluetooth, Aux)
 - HTTP (deps: Network)
 - TCP (deps: Network)
 - UDP (deps: Network)
 - Window (deps: Display, Keyboard, Cursor, WGPU)
 - EmberFS (deps: VFS)
 - WASI (deps: EmberFS, TCP, UDP)
 - Transcoder (deps: WGPU)
 - Camera (deps: Built-in Camera, USB, Transcoder)
