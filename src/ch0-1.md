# What is Quantii?
Quantii is a general-purpose operating system written in Rust.  The intent of
Quantii is to provide a secure and portable OS model based around WebAssembly.

In order to support existing software, Quantii can run code compiled for wasi32.

Inspired by web technologies like WebAssembly and WGPU, as well as a
BSD-inspired syscall model, Quantii builds on modern trends in technology and
takes them to the extreme to create the most frictionless, futuristic OS that
will exist yet.

Current Quantii targets:
 - arm64 (Raspberry Pi 3/4)
 - riscv64imac (VisionFive / Sipeed LicheeRV)
